# How to contribute

## General information
This project uses React, alongside the [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) package for styling.
Code should be styled and formatted according to the [AirBnB Style Guide]
(https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). In addition, information for styling JSX portions of code 
for React can be found [here](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react).

## Getting started in VS Code
For the best development experience in VS code, please download the ESLint and Prettier plugins. 
This will allow the code to automatically be formatted according to the AirBnB JavaScript standard
whenever a file is saved.

# TODO
