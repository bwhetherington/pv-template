        <Typography paragraph>
          The city of Venice, Italy contains a large and unique collection of artifacts that are
          displayed on public view, dating as far back as the year 700 AD. The collection includes
          reliefs, roundels, confraternity insignia, coats of arms, flagpole pedestals,
          inscriptions, wellheads, street altars, and a variety of other secular and religious
          symbols of Venice's material culture. These artifacts have been largely neglected by the
          numerous preservation efforts that have been undertaken since the historic flood of 1966.
          This vernacular heritage, which records the various stages of the thousand-year evolution
          of Venice's history from the perspective of the citizens of yesteryear, is being saved by
          today's citizens through a combination of high technology, social networks, and citizen
          engagement.

          Where did the data come from?
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          The primary sources for these data are the catalogs of Alberto Rizzi, surveys by
          volunteers from the Earthwatch Institute, and the work of university students from
          Worcester Polytechnic Institute. During the past 25 years, extensive surveys have been
          conducted in Venice and the islands of its lagoon, and virtually every type of public art
          has been cataloged and verified under the guidance of Archeoclub d'Italia, one of the
          pre-eminent heritage preservation organizations in Italy.
