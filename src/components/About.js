      <Typography paragraph>
        The city of Venice, Italy contains a large and unique collection of artifacts that are
        displayed on public view, dating as far back as the year 700 AD. The collection includes
        reliefs, roundels, confraternity insignia, coats of arms, flagpole pedestals, inscriptions,
        wellheads, street altars, and a variety of other secular and religious symbols of Venice's
        material culture. These artifacts have been largely neglected by the numerous preservation
        efforts that have been undertaken since the historic flood of 1966. This vernacular
        heritage, which records the various stages of the thousand-year evolution of Venice's
        history from the perspective of the citizens of yesteryear, is being saved by today's
        citizens through a combination of high technology, social networks, and citizen engagement.

        Where did the data come from?
      </Typography>
      <Typography paragraph>
        The primary sources for these data are the catalogs of Alberto Rizzi, surveys by volunteers
        from the Earthwatch Institute, and the work of university students from Worcester
        Polytechnic Institute. During the past 25 years, extensive surveys have been conducted in
        Venice and the islands of its lagoon, and virtually every type of public art has been
        cataloged and verified under the guidance of Archeoclub d'Italia, one of the pre-eminent
        heritage preservation organizations in Italy.
