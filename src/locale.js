        content: `
          The city of Venice, Italy contains a large and unique collection of artifacts that are
          displayed on public view, dating as far back as the year 700 AD. The collection includes
          reliefs, roundels, confraternity insignia, coats of arms, flagpole pedestals, inscriptions,
          wellheads, street altars, and a variety of other secular and religious symbols of Venice's
          material culture. These artifacts have been largely neglected by the numerous preservation
          efforts that have been undertaken since the historic flood of 1966. This vernacular
          heritage, which records the various stages of the thousand-year evolution of Venice's
          history from the perspective of the citizens of yesteryear, is being saved by today's
          citizens through a combination of high technology, social networks, and citizen engagement.
